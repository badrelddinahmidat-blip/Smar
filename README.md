## Configuration

### File Upload Settings

The application is configured with the following limits:
- **Maximum file size**: 16MB
- **Allowed file types**: PDF only
- **Upload directory**: `uploads/`

To modify these settings, edit the configuration variables in `app.py`:

```python
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'           # Upload directory
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'pdf'}        # Allowed file extensions
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 16 * 1024 * 1024    # Max file size in bytes
```

### Database

The application uses SQLite for data storage. The database file (`library.db`) is created automatically when you first run the application.

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    author TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    upload_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

The application runs in debug mode by default, which provides:
- Automatic reloading when code changes
- Detailed error messages
- Debug console

### Customization

#### Styling
- Edit `static/style.css` to customize the appearance
- The application uses Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- Font Awesome icons are included for better UI

#### Functionality
- Add new routes in `app.py`
- Create new templates in the `templates/` directory
- Add JavaScript functionality in `static/script.js`

## Security Considerations

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Change the secret key**:
   ```python
   app.secret_key = 'your-production-secret-key'
   ```

2. **Disable debug mode**:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=False)
   ```

3. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration

4. **Implement user authentication** if needed

5. **Add file type validation** beyond just extension checking

6. **Use HTTPS** for secure file uploads

### File Upload Security

The application includes basic security measures:
- File extension validation
- Secure filename handling
- File size limits
- Upload directory isolation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - Change the port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`

2. **Permission denied for uploads**
   - Ensure the `uploads/` directory has write permissions

3. **Database errors**
   - Delete `library.db` to reset the database
   - The database will be recreated on next run

4. **File upload fails**
   - Check file size (must be under 16MB)
   - Ensure file is a valid PDF
   - Check upload directory permissions

### Error Messages

- **"No file selected"**: Make sure to select a PDF file
- **"Invalid file type"**: Only PDF files are allowed
- **"File not found"**: The uploaded file may have been moved or deleted
